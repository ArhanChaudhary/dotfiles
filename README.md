# dotfiles

My MacOS dotfiles. The setup on a brand new Mac is as follows:

```zsh
xcode-select --install
git clone https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/dotfiles ~
cd ~/dotfiles
source install.sh
```

Please note that my dotfiles are tailed to my specific use, and I have not made any attempt to make my configuration general purpose.

Additionally, the install script is entirely untested.
